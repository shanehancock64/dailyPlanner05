For this assignment I had to create a daily planner that had the folllowing:
1. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. Presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
3. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. I can enter an event.
5. The text for that event is saved in local storage. 

I went with a more basic If/ELSE approach to get the time blocks correct to keep it from getting too complicated.
